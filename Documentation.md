## Description 
In this project a Machine Learning model was created to analyse sentiment of users from their comments/reviews.
## Preprocessing

For model, pre-processing of the dataset was done in-order to make it suitable for training and later it was complied into a CSV file for ease of work. 
**Preprocessing steps include
1 - Creating CSV of both pos and neg files
2 - Merging of files

## Modeling
we have applied 4 different deep learning model in this dataset for comapring of results between models.
1 - Lstm
2 - SimpleRNN
3 - GRU
4 - HybridGRU-RNN
## Model saved/weights
**Every model have its weights file in .h5 format so you can further use it for development purpose.

## How to run?
if you want to run .py files like creating csv and merging csv you have to change the path of files
if jupiter files than just load it in google colab or run it in anaconda(jupiter).
## Results
Present in files
